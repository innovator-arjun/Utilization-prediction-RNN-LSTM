During unplanned/outage/manintanance, the activity or data wont be captured
2 servers we are monitioirng 09 & 10
count and sum we need clarity
column description would add value
Data is missing for almost 3 months
CPU, network, disk, memory information will add value ie activity on the corresponding time
Business transaction TMSEfforts data is sparse we need more data for prediction
maximum 1 year of data is maintained
Server information should be captured for good prediction, all the nodes should be captured for correlation 
We will start with one application
Connect Arun for activity(cpu, memory, disk and  network) , so that information can be extracted
Analtyics information , like how many user are using the application
10 ms is marking as an error, we need the activity of the server  so that the root cause will be captured. It will be usefull to capture it is normal or abnormal activity
Sidescope, we need some samples for analysis/correlation
Linux, RHEL, ubuntu OS are used, we have to check the installation process to cpature the server activity
Only one day data is shared, expecting data fro 1 year to get a good understanding
